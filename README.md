This repository presents my work in my capstone class. Our group did our group project on Kaggle's Home Credit Default Project

# Business Problem and Objective
Home Credit is a financial institution that provides loans for people with little or no credit history. Since many of their customers have this problem, most of their customers would be rejected at other places. This is a problem because Home Credit doesnâ€™t want to reject clients that can repay their loans. Thus, causing the company to lose potential profit and not be able to help people that need it. If Home Credit can come up with a viable solution, it can help reduce the risk of their clients defaulting on their loans. This not only will help their clients be more successful but will also lead to more profit for the company. This project will be a success if Home Credit is able to increase its number of customers, help more clients, and gain more revenue. Therefore, Home Credit's objective is to accuratelt assess their applicant's loan repayment capability so that that can extend loans to creditworthy indiciduals and decline those who are likely to default.
